MIGRATION & STARTUP NOTES
=========================

1) If you previously had Alembic errors about multiple heads:
   - Reset your database ONLY if you don't need the data:
       - Delete the SQLite file: webhr.db (or the path in settings.DATABASE_URL)
       - Or run: alembic stamp base
   - Otherwise, run a merge migration first (not included here).

2) Apply migrations:
   - alembic upgrade head

   The patched migration '20251005_leveling_extension.py' now safely skips
   adding columns on tables that don't exist yet instead of failing.

3) Seed an admin user (username=admin, password=admin):
   - python -m scripts.seed_admin

4) Run the app:
   - uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
